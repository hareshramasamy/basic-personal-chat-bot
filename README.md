# Basic Personal Chat Bot

This is a **learning-focused Generative AI project** built to explore:
- Prompt engineering with LLMs
- Conversational memory handling
- Using OpenAI APIs
- Building chat UIs with Gradio

The chatbot loads personal documents (PDF + text) and responds as a conversational persona.

⚠️ Note: This version uses static context injection. Future versions will add
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), embeddings, and document search.
